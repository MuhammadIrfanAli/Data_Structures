First_HashTable :
The hash table uses chaining and LinkedList. The HashTable is created with
a fixed size. It supports the insert and lookup commands. The
constructor takes, as a parameter, the value of the parameter a.

HashTable with Open Addressing and Linear Probing:
The same hash function was implemented with a different hash table,
which uses open addressing, with linear probing. This HashTable is
initially created with a small size; it supports resizing along with
insert and lookup. Similar to the previous hashtable, the constructor
takes, as a parameter, the value of the parameter a.

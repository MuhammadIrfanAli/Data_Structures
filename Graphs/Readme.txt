Graphs Data Structures are implemented to construct the minimum cost network.

From the user's point of view, the program loads a graph and finds the shortest path between two locations. 

The program offers the user a menu of choices, as shown below:

Your options are:

(1) Choose a new graph data file
(2) Find shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm
(3) Compute the minimal spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm
(4) Quit

TASK1: In the first part of this assignment, a program was written that searches for
files on personal computer more efficiently and obviously without using the windows search feature. The program reads 
the contents of a portion of the Windows directory tree from a text file.
Then, the user of your program can search for exact matches to any file or directory name. 
The program saves the directory contents in a Tree data structure.

TASK2: In this task, program was coded that reads key-value pairs from an input file 
and constructs a corresponding Binary Search Tree (BST). The nodes
in the BST are arranged according to the relative magnitude of the keys.

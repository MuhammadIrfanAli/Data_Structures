TASK1: In the first part of this assignment, a program was written that searches for
files on personal computer more efficiently and obviously without using the windows search feature. The program reads 
the contents of a portion of the Windows directory tree from a text file.
Then, the user of your program can search for exact matches to any file or directory name. 
The program saves the directory contents in a Tree data structure.

TASK2: In this task, program was coded that reads key-value pairs from an input file 
and constructs a corresponding Binary Search Tree (BST). The nodes
in the BST are arranged according to the relative magnitude of the keys. 

TASK3: Task 2 was repeated but this time all stored data was extracted from pairs.txt (or
names.txt) in an AVL tree. After prompting the user for the text fileâ€™s name, the program should also prompt
the user to choose the data structure to use, as follows:
- Pleas Choose Data Structure:
- 1) BST
- 2.) AVL
